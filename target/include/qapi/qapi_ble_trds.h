/**
 * @brief
 * The following declared type represents the prototype function for a
 * TDS instance event callback.  This function will be called
 * whenever a TDS instance event occurs that is associated with the
 * specified Bluetooth stack ID.

 * @details
 * The caller is free to use the contents of the TDS instance event data
 * ONLY in the context of this callback.  If the caller requires
 * the data for a longer period of time, then the callback function
 * MUST copy the data into another data buffer.
 *
 * This function is guaranteed NOT to be invoked more than once
 * simultaneously for the specified installed callback (i.e. this
 * function DOES NOT have be reentrant).  It needs to be noted however,
 * that if the same event callback is installed more than once, then the
 * event callbacks will be called serially.  Because of this, the
 * processing in this function should be as efficient as possible.
 *
 * It should also be noted that this function is called in the thread
 * context of a thread that the user does NOT own.  Therefore, processing
 * in this function should be as efficient as possible (this argument holds
 * anyway because another TDS instance event will NOT be processed while
 * this function call is outstanding).
 *
 * @note1hang
 * This function MUST NOT Block and wait for TDS instance events that can
 * only be satisfied by receiving other Bluetooth Protocol Stack events.
 * A Deadlock WILL occur because other event callbacks will NOT be issued
 * while this function is currently outstanding.
 *
 * @param[in]  BluetoothStackID      Unique identifier assigned to this
 *                                   Bluetooth Protocol Stack on which the
 *                                   event occurred.
 *
 * @param[in]  TRDS_Event_Data       Pointer to a structure that contains

 *                                   occurred.

/**
 * @brief

 *
 * This function may also be used to determine the size of the buffer to
 * hold the formatted data (see details).
 *
 * @details
 * The Buffer and BufferLength parameters should be set to the location
 * in the advertising data for the TDS Transport Block and the remaining
 * length of the advertising data. This way the caller does NOT have to
 * allocate memory for the user specified buffer. The advertising data is
 * a fixed size that MUST not be exceeded.
 *
 * If the BufferLength parameter is 0, the Buffer parameter may be
 * excluded (NULL), and this function will return a positive non-zero
 * value, which represents the size of the buffer needed to hold the
 * formatted data.  The TDS Client may use this size to allocate a buffer
 * necessary to hold the formatted data.
 *
 * This function may be called repeatedly to format multiple TDS
 * Transport Blocks into the buffer.
 *
 * It is the application's responsibility to make sure that the size of
 * the advertising data is NOT exceeded.
 *
 * @param[in]  TransportBlockData    A pointer to the TDS Transport Block
 *                                   data.

 * @param[out]  Buffer        The user specified buffer.
 *
 * @return      If this function is used to format the user specified
 *              buffer, then zero will be returned for success.
 *
 * @return      If this function is used to determine the size of the
 *              user specified buffer to hold the formatted data, then a
 *              positive non-zero value will be returned for success,
