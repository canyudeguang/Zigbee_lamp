 * @brief Secure Storage Module
 *
 * @details The secure storage module provides APIs to carry out basic operations on
 *          encrypted files.  The APIs supported by this module allow clients to carry
 *          out following operations:
 *          - Open an existing secure storage file or create a new file,
 *          - Read and write to a secure storage file within file system,
 *          - Close a secure storage file
 *
 * @note    Secure storage APIs can take time in order of seconds to return
 *          depending on the access speeds of the underlying flash media.
 *          Calling tasks/clients should be prepared to be blocked
 *          for this duration in secure storage APIs. It is mandatory to
 *          avoid calling secure storage APIs in time critical sections of the code.
 *
 * @code {.c}
 *     * The code snippet below demonstrates the use of secure storage APIs.
 *     * In the example below, a client creates a secure storage file using
 *     * QAPI_FS_O_CREAT mode. It then performs a write operation on the file.
 *     * It then sets the current location to the beginning of the file and reads the file.
 *     * For brevity, the sequence assumes that all calls succeed. Clients should
 *     * check the return status from each call.
 *
 *     uint8 buf[100];
 *     uint8 read_buf[100];
 *     uint32 buf_size = 100;
 *     int32 actual_offset;
 *     uint32 bytes_written, bytes_read;
 *     qapi_Status_t status;

 *                                 0x88, 0x99, 0xaa, 0xbb, 0xcc, 0xdd, 0xee, 0xff };

 *              QAPI_FS_O_RDWR | QAPI_FS_O_CREAT, user_password, sizeof(user_password));
