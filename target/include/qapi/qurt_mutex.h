  @brief Prototypes of mutex API.

  The QuRT mutex service supports two types of mutex behavior:
  - Recursive mutex 
  - Recursive mutex with priority inheritance.

  The two mutex types have different performance; in particular, mutex lock operations are slower with priority inheritance mutexes. 

  @note1hang Both mutex behaviors may not be supported on some target platforms.
  The mutex behavior is specified at system build time -- it cannot be changed at runtime.

  Locks the specified mutex. 

  If a thread performs a lock operation on a mutex that is not being used, the thread 
  gains access to the shared resource that is protected by the mutex and continues executing.

  If a thread performs a lock operation on a mutex (priority inheritance or recursive 
  mutex) that is already being used by another thread, the thread is suspended. When the
  mutex becomes available again (because the other thread has unlocked it), the thread is
  awakened and given access to the shared resource.

  If a thread is suspended on a mutex that supports priority inheritance and the 
  priority of the suspended thread is higher than the priority of the thread that has 
  locked the mutex, the thread with the mutex acquires the higher priority of the
  suspended thread. The locker thread blocks until the lock is available. The priority
  of the thread released by the mutex is restored to its original priority state.

  A thread is not suspended if it locks a recursive mutex that it has already locked by
  itself, however the mutex does not become available to other thread(s) until the thread 
  performs a balanced number of unlocks on the mutex.

  The lock operation is significantly slower for priority inheritance mutexes than it is 
  for recursive mutexes.

  If a thread performs a lock operation on a mutex that is not being used, the thread 
  gains access to the shared resource that is protected by the mutex and continues executing.

  If a thread performs a lock operation on a mutex (priority inheritance or recursive 
  mutex) that is already being used by another thread, the thread is suspended. When the
  mutex becomes available again (because the other thread has unlocked it), the thread is
  awakened and given access to the shared resource. 

  If a mutex is not available and the time exceeds the timeout interval, the API returns
  with the value QURT_EFAILED_TIMEOUT. 

  If a thread is suspended on a mutex that supports priority inheritance and the 
  priority of the suspended thread is higher than the priority of the thread that has
  locked the mutex, the thread with the mutex acquires the higher priority of the
  suspended thread. The locker thread blocks until the lock is available or time exceeds
  the timeout interval. The priority of the thread that released the mutex is restored 
  to its original priority state.

  More than one thread can be suspended on a mutex. When the mutex is unlocked, the thread
