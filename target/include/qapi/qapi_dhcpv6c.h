 * @brief DHCPv6 Client Service
 *
 * @addtogroup qapi_networking_dhcpv6c
 * @{
 *
 * @details DHCPv6 client is a mechanism to request an IPv6 address
 * from the DHCPv6 server. In order for the DHCPv6 client to obtain
 * an IPv6 address, it must first be enabled by calling the
 * qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_Enable() QAPI function. When this function is
 * called, the DHCPv6 client module internally opens an IPv6 UDP socket
 * on port 546. If a Router Advertisement has already been received
 * on the interface with the M bit set, the DHCPv6 client will send
 * a solicit message to request an IPv6 address. Otherwise, the
 * qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_New_Lease() QAPI function must be called in order
 * to explicitly send the solicit  message to request an IPv6 address.
 * If the host no longer needs the IPv6 address obtained through DHCPv6
 * client, it may call the qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_Release_Lease() QAPI function
 * to release its IPv6 address. Consequently, it may call the
 * qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_Disable() QAPI function to disable the DHCPv6 client,
 * which will internally close the IPv6 UDP socket on port 546 that was
 * previously opened with a call to qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_Enable().
 * The module is using callbacks to notify the caller when a new IPv6
 * address is obtained or release. It is highly advised to register
 * both the DHCPv6c_New_Lease_Complete_CB (callback that is called when a
 * new IPv6 address is obtained) and the DHCPv6c_Release_Lease_Complete_CB
 * (callback that is called when the IPv6 address is released) prior to
 * calling the qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_Enable() QAPI function.
 *
 * The DHCPv6 client can also be used to obtain an IPv6 prefix that would
 * be advertised on some other interface. In order to obtain an IPv6 prefix,
 * the DHCPv6 must be enabled (using the qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_Enable() QAPI function).
 * To lease the actual prefix, the qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_New_Lease() function must
 * be called with the first parameter being the interface name on which the
 * DHCPv6 client is running, and the second parameter being the interface
 * name for which the prefix is desired.
 *
 * To release the prefix, the qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_Release_Lease() function must
 * be called with the first parameter being the interface name on which
 * the DHCPv6 client is running, and the second parameter being the interface
 * name for which the prefix was previously obtained and now is required to be
 * released.
 *
 * @code {.c}
 * // Code snippet demonstrating usage of the DHCPv6 client
 * // Assuming that "wlan1" is the station interface on which
 * // DHCPv6 client will be running, and "wlan0" is the Soft AP
 * // interface for which a prefix is desired.
 *
 * // Register IPv6 lease & release callbacks for "wlan1" interface
 * qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_Register_New_IPv6_Lease_Complete_Callback(
 *   "wlan1",
 *   DHCPv6c_New_IPv6_Lease_Complete_CB,
 *   NULL
 *   );
 * qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_Register_Release_IPv6_Lease_Complete_Callback(
 *   "wlan1",
 *   DHCPv6c_Release_IPv6_Lease_Complete_CB,
 *   NULL
 *   );
 *
 * // Register prefix lease & release callbacks for "wlan0" interface
 * qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_Register_New_Prefix_Lease_Complete_Callback(
 *   "wlan0",
 *   DHCPv6c_New_Prefix_Lease_Complete_CB,
 *   NULL
 *   );
 * qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_Register_Release_Prefix_Lease_Complete_Callback(
 *   "wlan0",
 *   DHCPv6c_Release_Prefix_Lease_Complete_CB,
 *   NULL
 *   );
 *
 * // Enable DHCPv6 client on the "wlan1" interface
 * qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_Enable("wlan1");
 *
 * // Obtain IPv6 address for wlan1 interface
 * qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_New_Lease("wlan1", "wlan1");
 *
 * // Obtain Prefix for "wlan0" interface
 * qapi_Net_DHCPv6c_New_Lease("wlan1", "wlan0");
 *

 *
 * // Release the IPv6 address for wlan1 interface

 * // Release the Prefix for the wlan0 interface
