 * @details This file describes QAPIs for network buffer allocation and deallocation.
 * When an application wants to send data over a communication socket, it first has to allocate
 * a network buffer. There are two types of network buffers:
 * - Local (application) buffers -- These buffers are allocated from the heap using the
 * QAPI_NETBUF_APP flag. These buffers are owned and maintained by the application, and the
 * stack copies the data from it (on TX) and to it (on RX). The application can reuse the buffer
 * once it was sent or once done processing the incoming data.
 * - System buffers -- These buffers are allocated from the internal stack memory using the
 * QAPI_NETBUF_SYS flag. Using this option enables the Zero-Copy mechanism, which may improve
 * performance and reduce power due to skipping the memory copy from the application memory
 * to the stack memory. These buffers are shared between the application and the stack and some
 * restrictions apply: The application does not own the buffer once it was sent and it must
 * allocate a new one in order to transmit more data. Upon receiving a system buffer, the
 * application must free it once done processing. Note that a system buffer can be a list of
 * chained buffers.
 *
 * @code {.c}
 *
 * qapi_Net_Buf_t *my_buf;
 *
 * do {
 *   // Allocate a buffer of 1200 bytes
 *   qapi_Net_Buf_t my_buf = qapi_Net_Buf_Alloc(1200, QAPI_NETBUF_SYS);
 *
 *   if(!my_buf) {
 *   	// No memory, wait and retry
 *   	sleep(1);
 *   	continue;
 *   }
 * }
 * while(0);
