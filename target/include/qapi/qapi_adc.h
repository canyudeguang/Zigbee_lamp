 * @brief Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
 *
 * @addtogroup qapi_adc
 * @{
 *
 * An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) allows an analog signal to be
 * sampled and digitally represented. The SoC features an on-die
 * ADC that supports reading multiple channels. Both single-ended and
 * differential inputs can be measured. The ADC can perform single-
 * shot and recurring measurements. ADC samples are stored in an
 * internal FIFO and can be popped out with or without DMA. Callbacks
 * can be registered for amplitude thresholds and the FIFO sample count
 * threshold.
 *
 * ADC is configurable via run-time and static parameters. Please
 * see the ADC tunable board file for the statically defined
 * parameters.
 *
 * This programming interface allows client software to configure
 * channels, perform single readings, perform recurring readings,
 * set threshold, and get ADC data samples. The code snippet below
 * shows an example usage. Consult the ADC tunable board file
 * for the configurable settings that are run-time set.
 *
 * @code {.c}
 *
 *
 *  * The code snippet below demonstrates use of this interface. The example
 *  * below opens ADC to obtain a handle, gets the number of channels, reads
 *  * each ADC channel, and then closes the handle.
 *
 *   qapi_Status_t status;
 *   qapi_ADC_Handle_t handle;
 *   uint32_t num_channels;
 *   uint32_t channel;
 *   qapi_ADC_Read_Result_t result;
 *
 *   status = qapi_ADC_Open(&handle, QAPI_ADC_ATTRIBUTE_NONE);
 *   if (status != QAPI_OK) { ... }
 *
 *   status = qapi_ADC_Get_Num_Channels(handle, &num_channels);
 *   if (status != QAPI_OK) { ... }
 *
 *   for (channel = 0; channel < num_channels; channel++)
 *   {
 *      status = qapi_ADC_Read_Channel(handle, channel, &result);
 *      if (status != QAPI_OK) { ... }
 *
 *      // result.microvolts contains the reading
 *   }
 *
 *   status = qapi_ADC_Close(handle, false);
 *   if (status != QAPI_OK) { ... }

/**
*  Queues a data transfer.
*
*  This function is used to get ADC data samples from the internal
*  FIFO, convert them from raw ADC code to physical values, and then
*  store them in a client's buffers. This is a nonblocking call
*  versus qapi_ADC_Get_Data().
*
*  When the data has been transfered to the client's buffer, a
*  callback function is called. At that time, the client can
*  extract the ADC data samples and optionally requeue the descriptor.
*
*  The buffers stop being filled when either a channel's buffer
*  fills up or the ADC conversion state has returned to Idle. If the ADC's
*  conversion state is set to Idle, any remaining transfers after
*  the FIFO has been drained are completed with zero samples. Also,
*  if the ADC configuration changes, the buffers are completed with
*  zero samples (since the descriptors may need to be updated if the enabled
*  channel changes).
*  @newpage
*  A descriptor must be provded for each enabled channel. The number of
*  descriptors specified should be equal the number of enabled channels
*  or an error is returned.
*
*  The ADC driver keeps the RAM banks with the client's buffer enabled
*  while a transfer is in progress and prevents low power modes. Therefore,
*  it is reccomended to let the FIFO fill up to a client-defined threshold
*  and then queue transfers to drain it. To make sure the FIFO does not
*  overflow, it is recommended to queue multiple transfers so the ADC can
*  fill buffers while clients are processing samples in another buffer.
*
*  @note1hang Do not let input desc go out of scope until either 1) the DMA done
*             callback is received, 2) the DMA transfer is canceled, or 3) the ADC
