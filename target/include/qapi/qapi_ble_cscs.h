 * that if the same Callback is installed more than once, hen the

 * It should also be noted that this function is called in the Thread
 * Context of a Thread that the User does NOT own.  Therefore, processing
 * in this function should be as efficient as possible (this argument holds
 * anyway because another CSCS Event will not be processed while this
 * function call is outstanding).
 *
 * @note1hang
 * This function MUST NOT Block and wait for events that can only be
 * satisfied by Receiving other Bluetooth Stack Events.  A Deadlock
 * WILL occur because other Callbacks might not be issued while
