  @brief   Prototypes of the pipe interface API  
   This is a pipe or message queue
   
   The QuRT pipe service is used to perform synchronized exchanges of data streams
   between threads.
   
   The size of the pipe is defined as a pipe attribute.
   
   A message to be sent over pipe is called an element. An element is of fixed size,
   defined as a pipe attribute.
   
   Multiple threads can read from or write to a single pipe.

EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS
   None.

INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
   None.
