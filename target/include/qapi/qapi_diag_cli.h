 * @brief Command Line Interface (CLI)
 *
 * @details The command line interface (CLI) implements an extensible mechanism for device-resident
 *          modules to interact with an external agent. The interaction consists of
 *          a stimulus sent by the external agent and action performed by the client,
 *          followed by a dispatch of the result of the action to the agent. The external agent
 *          is typically a software program residing on a host PC connected
 *          to the device via a serial interface like UART or USB. The Stimulus and
 *          Return results are strings. The CLI module implements functionality
 *          that is necessary to processes inbound command strings
 *          from the external agent and return response strings to the external agent.
 * 
 *          Via the CLI interface, clients can register a callback function corresponding
 *          to a command token string. If the command string from an external agent
 *          contains the registered command token and optional command payload,
 *          this module invokes a client callback passing the entire command string
 *          to the client module.
 * 
 *          The interface also provides a mechanism for client modules to return a
 *          response string, which is forwarded to the external agent. Clients 
 *          have the option of not returning a response string, in which case the CLI
 *          module will send an acknowledgement to the external agent.
 * 
 * @note    The interface allows only one outstanding command at any given time;
 *          i.e., until the command being processed does not return either a
 *          response or an acknowledgement, the next command will not be processed.
 *          
 *
 * @code {.c}
 *
 *    * The code snippet below demonstrates the use of the CLI interface. In this example,
 *    * a client registers for command token string "my_test" and returns
 *    * a response string.
 *    *
 *    * For brevity, the sequence assumes that all calls succeed. Clients should
 *    * check the return status from each call.
 *
 *    // Callback Definition
 *    qapi_Status_t client_callback(const char* cmd_str,
 *                                  size_t cmd_str_len,

 *                                  size_t* rsp_len)
 *
 *    {
 *      *rsp_len = strlen("success");
 *      if (*rsp_len < rsp_buf_len)
 *      {
 *        strlcpy(rsp_buf, "success", *rsp_len);
 *        return QAPI_OK;
 *      }
