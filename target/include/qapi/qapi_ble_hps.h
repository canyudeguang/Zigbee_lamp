/**
 * @brief
 * Responds to a request received
 * from an HPS client to prepare the HPS URI, HTTP Headers, or Entity
 * Body Characteristic data for a write.
 *
 * @details
 * This function should not be called while an HTTP request is
 * outstanding, since the HPS client should not prepare/write the URI,
 * HTTP Headers, or the HTTP Entity Body while an HTTP request is being
 * executed, especially since the HPS server will update the HTTP Headers
 * and HTTP Entity Body with information received in the HTTP response.
 * A subsequent write by an HPS client for the HTTP Headers or HTTP
 * Entity Body may overwrite the response information that has been set
 * by the HPS server. Since this behavior is undefined, it is
 * recommended that, if an HTTP request is currently outstanding and a
 * request has been dispatched to prepare/write the URI, HTTP Headers, or
 * HTTP Entity Body characteristics, it should be rejected with the
 * ErrorCode parameter set to
 * QAPI_BLE_ATT_PROTOCOL_ERROR_CODE_PROCEDURE_ALREADY_IN_PROGRESS.
 *
 * This event is primarily provided to reject a GATT Prepare Write
 * request for optional security reasons, such as the HPS client has
 * insufficient authentication, authorization, or encryption. This is
 * required if the HPS server needs additional security. Therefore, we
 * will not pass the prepared data up to the application until the
 * GATT Execute Write request has been received by the HPS server, and
 * the prepared writes are not cancelled. If the prepared data is
 * written, the QAPI_BLE_HPS_ET_SERVER_WRITE_CHARACTERISTIC_REQUEST_E
 * event will be dispatched to the application. Otherwise, the prepared
 * data will be cleared.
 *
 * The ErrorCode parameter must be a valid value from qapi_ble_hpstypes.h
