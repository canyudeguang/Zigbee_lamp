 * @brief Filesystem Module
 * 
 * @addtogroup qapi_fs
 * @{
 * 
 *
 * The filesystem module provides APIs to carry out basic operations on
 * files.The APIs supported by this filesystem allow clients to carry
 * out following operations:
 *  - Open an existing file or create a new file
 *  - Reading and Writing to a files within filesystem
 *  - Closing a file
 *  - Rename an existing file
 *  - Unlink file operation which deletes a file
 *  - File stat and Filesystem stat operations
 *  - Iterate over all files in filesystem
 *
 * Filesystem APIs can take time in order of seconds to return
 * depending on the access speeds of the underlying flash media.
 * Calling tasks/clients should be prepared to be blocked
 * for this duration in Filesystem APIs. It is mandatory to
 * not call filesystem APIs in time crtical sections of the code.
 * @code {.c}
 *
 *     /\*
 *     * Code snippet below demonstrates usage of certain filesystem APIs.
 *     * In the example below a client creates a file in filesystem using
 *     * QAPI_FS_O_CREAT mode. Carries out a write operation on the file.
 *     * Then does a read and a stat operation on the same file.
 *     * For Brevity, the sequence assumes that all calls succeed. Clients should
 *     * check return status from each call.
 *     *\/
 *     uint8 buf[100];
 *     uint8 read_buf[100];

 *     uint32 bytes_written, bytes_read;

 *     qapi_Fs_Write(fd, buf, buf_size, &bytes_written);
