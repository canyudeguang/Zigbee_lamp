 *
 * This function is guaranteed not to be invoked more than once

 * that if the same event callback is installed more than once, the

 * processing in this function should be as efficient as possible.
 *
 * It should also be noted that this function is called in the thread
 * context of a thread that the user does not own. Therefore, processing
 * in this function should be as efficient as possible (this argument holds
 * anyway because another ESS instance event will not be processed while
 * this function call is outstanding).
 *
 * @note1hang

 * A Deadlock will occur because other event callbacks will not be issued
 * while this function is currently outstanding.
