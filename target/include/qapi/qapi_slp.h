/**
 * Places a latency restriction.
 *
 * Clients do not vote directly for or
 * against a particular low power mode/sleep state. Instead, clients place
 * constraints in terms of latency.
 *
 * Latency, in this case, is defined as the maximum time (in us) acceptable
 * (to the client) between a hardware interrupt firing and sleep unlocking
 * interrupts. The latency for a particular low power mode is determined by the
 * round trip time (entry + exit) for that mode, i.e., the time to perform all
 * the steps to enter the mode (in software and hardware) plus the time to
 * perform all the steps to exit the mode.
 *
 * If the caller does not have a particular interrupt latency restriction, it
 * may use one of the QAPI_SLP_LAT_* defines to place a more notional vote.
 *
 * @note1hang The latency input specified using this API is aggregated with other
 * latency inputs in the system to determine a final latency restriction.
 * When choosing a low power mode, sleep will select the low power mode that
 * satisfies this aggregated restriction.
 *
 * @param[in] latency  Acceptable amount of time (in us) between an interrupt
 *                     firing and its handler being invoked OR a QAPI_SLP_LAT_*
 *                     define. A value of 0 cancels any previously specified
 *                     latency restriction.
