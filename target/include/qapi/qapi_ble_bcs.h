 * that if the same callback is installed more than once, the
 * callbacks will be called serially. Because of this, the processing
 * in this function should be as efficient as possible.
 *
 * It should also be noted that this function is called in the Thread
 * Context of a Thread that the user does not own. Therefore, processing
 * in this function should be as efficient as possible (this argument holds
 * anyway because another BCS Service Event will not be processed while this
 * function call is outstanding).

 * will occur because other callbacks might not be issued while
 * this function is currently outstanding.
