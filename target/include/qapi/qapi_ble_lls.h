 * @brief
 * This declared type represents the prototype function for
 * an LLS Service Event Receive Data Callback. This function will be called
 * whenever an LLS Service Event occurs that is associated with the
 * specified Bluetooth stack ID.

 * @details
 * The caller should use the contents of the LLS Profile Event Data
 * only in the context of this callback. If the caller requires
 * the data for a longer period of time, the callback function
 * must copy the data into another data buffer.
 *
 * This function is guaranteed not to be invoked more than once
 * simultaneously for the specified installed callback (i.e., this
 * function does not have be reentrant). It should be noted, however,
 * that if the same callback is installed more than once, the
 * callbacks will be called serially. Because of this, the processing
 * in this function should be as efficient as possible.
 *
 * It should also be noted that this function is called in the Thread
 * Context of a Thread that the user does not own. Therefore, processing
 * in this function should be as efficient as possible (this argument holds
 * anyway because another LLS Service Event will not be processed while this
 * function call is outstanding).
 *
 * @note1hang
 * This function must not block and wait for events that can only be
 * satisfied by receiving other Bluetooth Stack Events. A Deadlock
 * will occur because other callbacks might not be issued while
 * this function is currently outstanding.
