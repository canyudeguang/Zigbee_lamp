 *
 * @details The BSD-Socket interface API is a collection of standard functions
 * that allow the application to include Internet communications capabilities.
 * In general, the BSD-Socket interface relies on Client-Server architecture,
 * and uses a Socket object for every operation.
 *
 * The interface supports Both TCP (SOCK_STREAM) and UDP (SOCK_DGRAM), Server
 * mode and Client mode, as well as IPv4 and IPv6 communication.
 * A socket can be configured with specific options (see socket options below).
 * Due to the memory constrained properties of the device, it is mandatory to
 * follow the BSD-Socket programming guidelines, and in particular, check for
 * return values of each function. There is a chance that an operation may
 * fail due to resource limitations. For example, the send function may be
 * able to send only some of the data and not all of it in a single call.
 * A consequent call with the rest of the data is required. In some other
 * cases, an application thread may need to sleep in order to allow the system
 * to clear its queues, process data, and so on.
 *
 * The zero-copy mechanism can be enabled by calling qapi_setsockopt() with the option 'level' being
 * SOL_SOCKET or IPPROTO_IP and 'optname' being SO_CALLBACK (for TCP) or SO_UDPCALLBACK (for UDP). \n
 * For example: \n
 * To enable TCP zero-copy: \n
 * @code  qapi_setsockopt(handle, IPPROTO_IP, SO_CALLBACK,
 *                        (void *)tcp_rx_callback, 0); @endcode \n
 * To enable UDP zero-copy: \n
 * @code  qapi_setsockopt(handle, IPPROTO_IP, SO_UDPCALLBACK,
 *                        (void *)udp_rx_callback, 0); @endcode \n
 * where, 'handle' is the socket handle returned from qapi_socket(). 'tcp_rx_callback' and
 * 'udp_rx_callback' are callback functions called from the stack to inform the application of
 * received data packets. \n
 * The callback functions should conform to the following prototype: \n
 * @code
 *      int32_t (*)(void *so, void *pkt, int32_t errcode) tcp_rx_callback;
 *   int32_t (*)(void *so, void *pkt, int32_t errcode, void *from,
 *               int32_t family) udp_rx_callback; @endcode
 * where \n
 *      'so' is a pointer to an internal socket object \n
 *      'pkt' is a pointer to an system buffer (qapi_Net_Buf_t) containing received data for
 *      the socket if it is not NULL. \n
 *      ((qapi_Net_Buf_t *)pkt)->nb_prot points to the start of the received data, and \n
 *      ((qapi_Net_Buf_t *)pkt)->nb_plen indicates the number of bytes of received data in the buffer. \n
 *      The amount of data in the buffer chain is available in ((qapi_Net_Buf_t *)pkt)->nb_tlen field
 *      of the first buffer in the chain. \n
 *      'errcode' is used by the stack to report some events. If it is not 0, it is a socket error
 *      indicating that an error or other event has occurred on the socket. For TCP, typical nonzero
 *      values will be ESHUTDOWN, indicating that the connected peer has closed its end of the connection
 *      and will send no more data; and ECONNRESET, indicating that the connected peer has abruptly closed
 *      its end of the connection and will neither send nor receive more data. \n
 *      'from' is a pointer to struct sockaddr_in if 'family' is AF_INET or to struct sockaddr_in6
 *      if 'family' is AF_INET6. 'from' indicates the sender of received data.
 *
 * If the callback function returns 0, it indicates that it has accepted responsibility for the system
 * buffer and will return it to the stack (via call to qapi_Net_Buf_Free(pkt, QAPI_NETBUF_SYS)) when it
 * no longer needs the buffer. If the callback function returns any nonzero value, it indicates to the
 * stack that it has not accepted responsibility for the system buffer.
